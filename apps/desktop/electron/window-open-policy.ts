/**
 * Window-open policy for every BrowserWindow's webContents.
 *
 * In the Electron desktop app, every external URL we open on purpose is routed
 * through the audited `hermes:openExternal` IPC channel (see `openExternalUrl`
 * in main.ts, which enforces an http/https/mailto scheme allowlist and guards
 * file: through the IPC path resolver). The `window.open` / `target=_blank`
 * path that reaches `setWindowOpenHandler` is therefore, inside Electron, only
 * ever driven by content we did NOT initiate — most dangerously untrusted HTML
 * rendered in sandboxed `allow-scripts` iframes (artifact previews).
 *
 * GHSA-9f4c-93c8-jc8g (CVE-2026-70608, High 7.2) lets such a sandboxed iframe
 * reach this handler with NO user interaction and WITHOUT `allow-popups`. If
 * the handler opens `details.url` as a side effect, a malicious artifact can
 * force the user's real browser to an attacker-chosen URL. There is no fixed
 * 40.x Electron release (the fix is 41.10.3+/42.0.1), so we defend at the seam
 * regardless of Electron version: deny every window-open request and NEVER open
 * a URL as a side effect here. Trusted opens keep working because they go
 * through the IPC channel, not this handler.
