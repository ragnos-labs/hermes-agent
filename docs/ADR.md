# Architecture Decision Records

## 2026-08-15: Durable, profile-scoped public execution read contract

Status: Accepted for the Release 1 source candidate. This status records the
architecture decision; it does not claim merge, package release, deployment,
or runtime enablement.

Context:
Hermes exposes useful process-local run, approval, session, Kanban, and UI
state, but none of those surfaces is a stable durable authority contract for
an external controller. Process dictionaries disappear on restart, chat and
session history do not prove an external effect, and operator projections may
lag or omit lifecycle transitions. A downstream reader needs versioned,
profile-scoped objects, detectable replay gaps, and terminal receipts that
cannot diverge from terminal state across a crash.

Decision:
- Add the provider-neutral `hermes.execution.read.v1` contract and closed
  packaged JSON Schema for executions, decisions, ordered events, receipts,
  capability negotiation, and errors.
- Store each profile's ledger at
  `{get_hermes_home()}/execution_contract.sqlite3`. Use explicit schema
  migration and startup recovery; use read-only SQLite connections for every
  public GET.
- Treat the ordered event table as a transactional outbox. Terminal state,
  evidence-backed receipt, and publication events commit in one transaction.
- Assert profile, authority, and executor identity in responses. Embed a
  profile fingerprint in public IDs so a cross-profile identifier fails with
  `403` instead of becoming an ambiguous `404`. Bind store metadata and every
  persisted public row to that same authority so a misplaced database cannot
  be projected under a different profile.
- Require an explicit executor evidence hook before publishing an external
  effect receipt. Generic chat, session, Kanban, tool-progress, or process-run
  completion terminates an effect-bearing execution as ambiguous and
  unproven.
- Add an optional profile-scoped `API_SERVER_READ_KEY` with only
  `execution:read`. Keep run submission, decision resolution, steering,
  stopping, and all other API authority behind the full `API_SERVER_KEY`.
- Retain ordered events for 30 days by default. Prune only a contiguous global
  prefix and return `410` with an explicit minimum cursor when replay history
  is gone.

Consequences:
- External controllers can read durable state across restart without using
  Hermes internals or mutation credentials.
- Existing `/v1/runs` remains a convenience projection and may carry a durable
  `execution_id`, but it is not the authority store.
- The API server refuses startup when the ledger cannot migrate or recover;
  a failed durable write degrades the profile's read contract instead of
  serving a healthy projection.
- Release 2 proposal/action dispatch, WebAuthn step-up, and public decision
  mutation remain separately gated. This decision does not authorize them.

## 2026-07-13: Scope plugin manager state by Hermes home/profile (keyed cache)

Status: Accepted

Context:
Hermes supports multiple profiles via different Hermes home directories.
Homes are switched two ways in a running process: the `HERMES_HOME`
environment variable (single-profile CLI/gateway processes), and the
context-local `set_hermes_home_override()` (`hermes_constants.py`), which
the multiplexed gateway worker (`gateway/run.py`'s `_profile_scope`) and
subagent/embedded callers use to serve several profiles from one
long-lived process. The override is a `ContextVar` and deliberately does
**not** mutate `os.environ`, since that would leak one profile's home
into every other concurrent task in the same process.

The plugin manager was a process-global single-slot singleton
(`_plugin_manager`). User-installed plugins are discovered from
`get_hermes_home() / "plugins"`, and context-engine plugins (e.g.
`hermes-lcm`) capture profile-scoped state — such as the LCM database
path — at registration time. A single-slot cache meant:

1. Switching homes via `set_hermes_home_override()` was invisible to a
   naive "did `HERMES_HOME` change" check, so the singleton silently kept
   serving the first profile's manager to every other profile in the
   process.
2. Even when a fresh `PluginManager` *was* created for a new home, plugin
   modules are imported into `sys.modules` as `hermes_plugins.<slug>` by
   `_load_directory_module`, and only that top-level module was ever
   replaced. A same-slug plugin's *relative* imports
   (`from . import state`) are cached separately under
   `hermes_plugins.<slug>.<submodule>`, and Python's import machinery
   resolves those from `sys.modules` first — so a profile switch could
   silently keep serving a previous profile's already-imported submodule
   code/state instead of re-executing the new profile's plugin.

Decision:
- Replace the single-slot singleton with a cache keyed on the *resolved*
  Hermes home path (`_plugin_managers_by_home: Dict[Path, PluginManager]`).
  `get_plugin_manager()` resolves the current home via `get_hermes_home()`
  (which itself already consults `get_hermes_home_override()` before
  `os.environ`), so both the env-var and context-local override paths are
  covered uniformly.
- `_plugin_manager` (the old single-slot name) is kept as a thin "last
  manager returned" pointer purely for backward compatibility with
  existing test code that does
  `monkeypatch.setattr(plugins_mod, "_plugin_manager", some_manager)`.
  When that name is monkeypatched to a manager the keyed cache doesn't
  know about, `get_plugin_manager()` treats it as an explicit injection
  and adopts it into the cache under the *current* resolved home, rather
  than discarding it.
- Both `PluginManager._load_directory_module` (initial/`force=True`
  reload within the same home) and the shared `_clear_plugin_submodules`
  helper (profile switch / test teardown) evict `sys.modules[module_name]`
  **and every name prefixed with `module_name + "."`** before a plugin
  slug is (re-)imported, so relative-import submodules can never survive
  a reload or a home switch.
- Test isolation (`tests/conftest.py`'s `_hermetic_environment` fixture)
  calls a new `_reset_plugin_managers_for_tests()` helper that drops the
  entire keyed cache and purges every plugin submodule from `sys.modules`
  between tests, instead of only resetting the single-slot pointer.

Consequences:
- Per-profile LCM instances (and any other context-engine plugin) use
  their own `{home}/lcm.db` regardless of whether the profile switch went
  through `HERMES_HOME` or `set_hermes_home_override()`.
- Plugin discovery remains cached within a profile for normal
  performance, and re-entering a previously-seen profile reuses its
  cached manager instead of rebuilding from scratch.
- Sequential *and* interleaved profile switching — in tests, the gateway
  multiplexer worker, or embedded callers using the context-local
  override — no longer leaks context-engine state, plugin module state,
  or stale relative-import submodules across profiles.
- Regression coverage exercises the real production path
  (`set_hermes_home_override()`) rather than only the env-var path, and
  includes a dedicated relative-import leak test.
